# Motors
To make the 3Pi+ move forwards or backwards the motors can be activated with the same PWM levels, set in the same direction.
The 3Pi+ can be made to move on an arc by activating the motors at different PWM levels, in the same direction.
The 3Pi+ can be made to rotate on the spot by activating the motors at the same PWM levels, in different directions

 minimum motor PWM forward - 15
 minimum motor PWM reverse - 13
